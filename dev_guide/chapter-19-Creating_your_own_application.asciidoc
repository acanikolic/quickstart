== Creating your own application

 What we didn't tell you about the <<sid-8094284>> is that it is generated from a Maven archetype. Using this archetype offers you the perfect opportunity to generate your own project.

To use the archetype to generate a new project, you should run:


----
mvn archetype:generate \
        -DarchetypeArtifactId=jboss-javaee6-webapp-archetype \
        -DarchetypeGroupId=org.jboss.spec.archetypes \
        -DarchetypeVersion=7.0.2.CR2 \
----

Maven will download the archetype and it's dependencies, and ask you some questions:

....
$&gt; mvn archetype:generate \
        -DarchetypeArtifactId=jboss-javaee6-webapp-archetype \
        -DarchetypeGroupId=org.jboss.spec.archetypes \
        -DarchetypeVersion=7.0.2.CR2 \

|Â |Instruction
|1| Enter the groupId you wish to use 
|2| Enter the artifactId you wish to use 
|3| Enter the version you wish to use, or just hit Enter if you wish to accept the default 1.0-SNAPSHOT 
|4| Enter the java package you wish to use, or just hit Enter if you wish to accept the default (which is copied from groupId ). 
|5| Finally, if you are happy with your choices, hit Enter and Maven will generate the project for you. 

|===============


 And that's it, you now have a brand new project with the same functionality as kitchensink , but customized with your details. 


[IMPORTANT]
.A blank canvas?
====
 The archetype contains some sample code to get you started. If you would prefer a blank canvas, with only a project skeleton, then use jboss-javaee6-webapp-archetype-blank as your archetype id. 


====



[IMPORTANT]
.Prefer Enterprise Applications (EARs)?
====
 The archetype generates a WAR project. With Java EE 6, you can include EJBs in your WAR, meaning you won't need an EAR until you need to divide your code into modules. If you would like to create an EAR based project then use jboss-javaee6-webapp-ear-archetype as your archetype id (or if you want a blank EAR, then jboss-javaee6-webapp-ear-archetype-blank ). 


====


 Of course, you can create a project from the archetype using Eclipse, saving you the step of importing it. First, choose File -&gt; New -&gt; Other :

 Select the Maven Project wizard:

 Locate the jboss-javaee6-webapp-archetype archetype: 


[WARNING]

 The image below is out of date, and the archetype id has changed to jboss-javaee6-webapp-archetype

 Now hit Ok . 

 Next, fill in the groupId and artifactId , and hit Finish :
